            <pre>
                I've always had a creative personality. I started designing product packaging and websites for various
                projects in school and college, and I realized I enjoyed creating practical and modern designs,
                especially in a digital format.

                I discovered I could apply what I enjoyed, and turn it into a career creating memorable user experiences
                through UI. After a few years of studying various art-based subjects, I looked into a career path that would allow me to be
                creative.

                I started studying UI design, I taught myself HTML and CSS, I then started a short course to
                learn JavaScript, I have done a few projects since, such as helping others build an online presence by designing their
                website or helping with the front-end development as a freelance, I also helped a start-up financial advice service build its online
                website and mobile app.

                My love for creating never stops, if I'm not designing prototypes or improving my coding, I'm indulging
                in my favorite hobby photography.
